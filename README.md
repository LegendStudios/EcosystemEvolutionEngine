# EcosystemEvolutionEngine
An Engine built with Unity to simulate an ecosystem and its evolution, while tracking the stats so you can see how the system evolves over time.
***
How big does the population get?
Do the animals evolve a fight or a flight reponce?? 
Who will rise to the top of the food chain?
Can we see multiple species evolve from one parent?
Can an entire ecosystem complete with a food chain evolve naturally from a singular simple organism? 
***
These questions and more are what this project aims to answer, in a fun and interactive way.
