# EcosystemEvolutionEngine
An Engine built with Unity to simulate an ecosystem and its evolution, while tracking the stats so you can see how the system evolves over time. How big dose the population get? Do the animals evolve to be fast and run away, or tough and fight predators? Who will rise to the top of the food chain? Can we see multiple species evolve from one parent? Can en entire ecosystem complete with a food chain evolve naturally from a singular simple organism? These questions and more are what this project aims to answer, in a fun and interactive way.
